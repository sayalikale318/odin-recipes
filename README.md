# Odin Recipes
This project is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
It consists of a main index page that links to multiple recipe pages. Each recipe page contains a description, ingredients list, preparation steps, and navigation back to the homepage.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to practice fundamental HTML concepts and basic Git workflow. It focuses on structure and clarity rather than styling.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I have demonstrated:
- Writing standard HTML boilerplate
- Creating structured content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images
- Organizing files and folders properly
- Linking between multiple pages using relative paths
- Using Git for version control
- Pushing a project to GitHub

## What I Learned
This project helped reinforce the importance of clean file structure, correct linking, and understanding how separate pages connect within a website. It also strengthened my confidence using Git and GitHub for project management.
This project is intentionally simple and serves as a foundation for upcoming CSS and layout-focused projects.
